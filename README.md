## CIANNA - Convolutional Interactive Artificial Neural Networks by/for Astrophysicists

CIANNA is a general-purpose deep learning framework mainly developed and used for astrophysical applications. Functionalities and optimizations are added based on relevance for astrophysical problem-solving. CIANNA can be used to build and train large neural network models for a wide variety of tasks and is provided with a high-level Python interface (similar to keras, pytorch, etc.). One of the specificities of CIANNA is its custom implementation of a YOLO-inspired object detector used in the context of galaxy detection in 3D radio-astronomical data cubes. The framework is fully GPU-accelerated through low-level CUDA programming.

**Note:** The current version is transitioning to the 1.0 release. The source code and the API documentation are up-to-date, but several modifications will happen in the upcoming days for all other pages / examples / etc.

&nbsp;

## How to use

Please read the [How to use](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA/wiki/3\)-How-to-use-(Python-interface)) Wiki page for a minimalistic tour of CIANNA capabilities on a simple example script and dataset.  
A full description of all the Python interface functions is available as an [API documentation](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA/wiki/4\)-Interface-API-documentation) page on the Wiki.  
Please also consider consulting the [Step-by-step installation guide](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA/wiki/Step-by-step-installation-guide-\(Ubuntu-20.04\)) to verify everything was installed correctly.  
Several Python scripts and notebooks are provided as [examples](https://github.com/Deyht/CIANNA/tree/CIANNA/examples) for different datasets and applications.
